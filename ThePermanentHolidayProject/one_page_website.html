					<h1>The Permanent Holiday</h1>
					<h2>Come Sail With Us!</h2>
					<p>Welcome! If you choose our company to introduce you to sailing you will leave refreshed and feeling confident on a sailboat! Contact us today to have a great time. We have catamarans or monohulls for you to learn on. Find out what makes them so different from each other below:</p>
					
			<h3>Monohull Sailboat-<blockquote cite="https://www.yachting.com/en/about-jachting/types-of-boat-on-offer/monohull-sailboat"></h3>
					<p>As their name suggests, they are sailing yachts with a single hull. The most important characteristic of these vessels is their stability. A monohull sailing yacht is almost impossible to capsize, making it extremely safe at sea. This extreme stability is provided by the keel and ballast.</p>
			<h3>Catamaran Sailboat-<blockquote cite="https://www.marineinsight.com/boating-yachting/main-types-of-catamarans-used-in-the-shipping-world/"></h3>
					<p>A catamaran is a boat that has two hulls instead of a single hull which the traditionally designed one-hulled boats have. Catamarans were designed to be fishing boats though their use has increased and widened manifold in today's times. The following points will enable to understand the boat and its types very clearly.</p>
			
			<h3>This video below will show you the difference between sailing the two boats. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.</h3>
